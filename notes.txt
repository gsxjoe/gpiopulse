# Structure: app.py and templates directory go in same directory
# if in user home: ex /home/pi there is already a Templates folder with capital T, ignore and create a new directory with lowercase t
# inside templates dirctory is your index.html file
#  templates  (this is folder)
#    index.html
#  app.py

# You will need to install Flask and RPi.GPIO
# if using latest pi os, as of 9/6/2025
# use: sudo apt install python3-flask
# sudo apt install python3-RPI.GPIO


# to auto run everytime pi boots:
# nano ~/.bashrc
# add as last line 
# Sudo Python3 /home/pathway/app.py  (home/pathway/app.py is substituted with your app.py location)
# if on reboot it asks for password then:
# go to root,
# sudo visudo
# add to last line:
# pi ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/app.py   (home/pi/app.py is substituted with your app.py location)

#save in place
